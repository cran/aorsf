\title{Variable selection}
\usage{
orsf_vs(object, n_predictor_min = 3, verbose_progress = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{(\emph{ObliqueForest}) a trained oblique random forest object (see \link{orsf}).}

\item{n_predictor_min}{(\emph{integer}) the minimum number of predictors allowed}

\item{verbose_progress}{(\emph{logical}) not implemented yet. Should progress be printed to the console?}
}
\value{
a \link[data.table:data.table]{data.table} with four columns:
\itemize{
\item \emph{n_predictors}: the number of predictors used
\item \emph{stat_value}: the out-of-bag statistic
\item \emph{variables_included}: the names of the variables included
\item \emph{predictors_included}: the names of the predictors included
\item \emph{predictor_dropped}: the predictor selected to be dropped
}
}
\description{
Variable selection
}
\details{
The difference between \code{variables_included} and \code{predictors_included} is
referent coding. The \code{variable} would be the name of a factor variable
in the training data, while the \code{predictor} would be the name of that
same factor with the levels of the factor appended. For example, if
the variable is \code{diabetes} with \code{levels = c("no", "yes")}, then the
variable name is \code{diabetes} and the predictor name is \code{diabetes_yes}.

\code{tree_seeds} should be specified in \code{object} so that each successive run
of \code{orsf} will be evaluated in the same out-of-bag samples as the initial
run.

               importance = 'anova')
