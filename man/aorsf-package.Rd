\title{aorsf: Accelerated Oblique Random Survival Forests}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Fit, interpret, and make predictions with oblique random survival forests. Oblique decision trees are notoriously slow compared to their axis based counterparts, but 'aorsf' runs as fast or faster than axis-based decision tree algorithms for right-censored time-to-event outcomes. Methods to accelerate and interpret the oblique random survival forest are described in Jaeger et al., (2023) \doi{10.1080/10618600.2023.2231048}.
